Question 1

What happens when you reference a variable that was initialized in a preceding
if conditional that was not executed?

Normally, a reference to an uninitialized variable causes Ruby to throw an
exception for "undefined method or local variable." But Ruby initializes
variables to nil if they are initialized in an unexecuted if condition.

Question 2

Does assignment to a hash value create a new object?

Answer: NO. Assignment of a variable to a hash value uses the same object
id as the value of the hash. So any mutations to the new variable will also
mutate the hash value.
This can be avoided with an assignment using the Object#clone method, or by
an assignment that uses concatenation, which creates a new object.
