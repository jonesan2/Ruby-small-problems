# The solution to this exercise will become a familiar pattern early during 
# your Launch School learning. We use a plain loop to solicit inputs until 
# we have a valid input, then exit that loop.

choice = nil
loop do
  puts '>> Do you want me to print something? (y/n)'
  choice = gets.chomp.downcase
  break if %w(y n).include?(choice)
  puts '>> Invalid input! Please enter y or n'
end
puts 'something' if choice == 'y'
